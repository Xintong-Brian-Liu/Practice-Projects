What I learn 
- :focus is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element
- transition happens when there is a change in the property 
- How to show class with pre-condition:
    /* If search has active class, input changes */
        .search.active .input {
        width: 200px;
        }
- When we need to add or remove class with click, we can use toggle
- .focus() usually is for input(), when it is called, keyboard is focus on input.
