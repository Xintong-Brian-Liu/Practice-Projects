Add active to circle, and use the number of active to calculate the length of progress bar.
What I learn
- Creating variable for css file
- use tranform: scale(0.98) to make animation for clicking button
- We need to set the outer container to be relative, so we can set the inter content position absolute
- justify-content: space-between: Distribute items evenly
                                  The first item is flush with the start,
                                  the last is flush with the end
