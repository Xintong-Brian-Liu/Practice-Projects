In this project, I learn
- How to use transition to make animation 
- How to use flex to expand or shrink element

New CSS:
- box-sizing: border-box; -> Tells the broswer to acconut for any border and padding in the value you specified for an element's width and height
- transition: property name | duration | easing function | delay
    We need two class with two different value with same property to make the transition.
    
- background-size: cover -> Scales the image as large as possible
